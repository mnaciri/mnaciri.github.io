          <p>Dogs are very impressive. They have an incredible ability to percieve the world with their nose. This is how they recognize other dogs or even humans.</p>
          
          <h2>Sense of smell</h2>
          <p>Scientists guess that dogs have a sense of smell 10.000 to 100.000 times more developed than ours. Dogs have 50 times more scent receptors than ours.</p>
          <p>Dogs are not equals about their ability to smell. Dogs with little nose like french bull dogs can't smell as well as german shepherds for example.</p>
          <p>Dogs can smell human emotions. Of course, emotions have no scent but dogs can detect a different smell from our scent due to our emotions. For instance, it has been proved that human sweat due to sport is not the same sweat due to fear. They have a sense as precise as this difference.</p>
          <p>They are very good to track objects or persons with their nose because they have the ability to separate scents and be focused to a precise one.</p>
          
          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>The vision of the dog is very different than ours. For example, they don't have the same spectrum of colors.</p>
          <a href="#">
            <div class="row">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/intelligence-colors.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
            </div>
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The spectrum of colours that human perceives VS. The spectrum of colours that dog perceives</span>
          <p>As you can see, humans has a tri-chromatic vision (red,green,blue). Dogs have a dichromatic vision (blue-purple,yellow). This difference is not a difficulty for dogs. Seeing-eye dogs, for instance, can't recognize green or red light. They know the position of the brighten light. So they know if they can croos the road or not.</p>
          <p>Dogs cannot see as precise as us in a long distance. For example at 6 meters, dog has the same vision as human at 22 meters.</p>
          
          <h2>Dog communication</h2>
          <p>Dogs have a lot of way to communicate with each other. Sounds can also be used. They can bark to announce their position or growl to say that they don't want to be disturbed. A different growl can be translated as a call for assistance. They also howl to indicate their presence or to know if they are alone. That is a need of companionship. Dogs can also cry when they are very sad.</p>
          <p>According to scientists, they can create a scent story with their urine during a walk. That's pretty impressive.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <div class="row">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/intelligence-aggressive.jpg" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            </div>
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Body language of an agressive dog</span>
          <p>They also have a body language. For instance, a dog with a contracted back and ears backwards is an agressive dog ready to fight.</p>
          <p>Dog also communicates with their tail. The alpha male is the dog which has his tail up. Conversely, a dog with a tail down (between the back legs) is the body language of a submissive dog.</p>
          <h2>Dog emotions</h2>
          <p>It has been scientifically proved that dogs can have complex emotions such as compassion. Some emotions that we think dogs can have are not perceived by them.</p>
          <p>Dogs can be excited, happy, disgusted. They also have the ability to feel fear, anger, joy, suspicion, distress and affection or love.</p>
          <p>Some very complex emotions can't be related with dogs; Such as shame, pride, guilt and contempt. Some people say (and a lot of fun videos on the internet) that dogs can be guilty. Unfortunately they can't. I've seen a TV show which made an experience. They bring dog owners with their best friend (I mean the dog). A scientist put a plate with a sausage. They ask the owner to order their dog not to eat the sausage and turn their back to their dog. Some dogs were very wise but some other dogs were very greedy. If the dog was wise, scientists hid the sausage to be sure the owner think that his dog ate the sausage. In every cases, dogs get the same positions and all owners thought their dog was guilty but not. The dog was scared because they can fell the owner emotion and they recognize this case as a punitive one.</p>
          <h2>Human-dog communication</h2>
          <p>After several years of life with dogs, it is relatively easy to communicate with a dog. Dogs are very good to recognize vocal orders. But they are also able to recognize our emotions. When someone is sad, they know it and compative dogs can be very comforting.</p>
          <h2>Scientific facts</h2>
          <p>I've found a study in my references that deals with dogs' sense of smell. Here is an experience: dogs have been tested about their smell memory.</p>
          <p>We use a sample that the dog should find during the test. The dog is supposed to find the right one out of 6.</p>
          <a href="#">
            <div class="row">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/graph_echantillon_renifler.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            </div>
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Purcentage of succesful discorver according to the position of the right sample.</span>
          <p>As you can see, dogs have more difficulties when the right sample is placed at the end of the line of samples.</p>
          <p>This experience is very interesting because it shows that dogs have a very short memory for smell. It can be very useful, for example if we use dogs to find a missing person. It is better to know how many times we should remember the dog the smell of the missing person.</p>
          <p>This study exposed another scientist fact about dogs. The experiment used a dog and calculated how many times the dog needed to analyse a sample. Here is the result:</p>
          <a href="#">
            <div class="row">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/graph_chien.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            </div>
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Duration of a sample recognition for a dog.</span>
          <p>It shows that the dog, exposed to the same sample many times reduce the time of smell detection to recognize a sample. It also reveals that blank sample is almost instantly detected. After several repetitions of the same sample, a different one given to the dog involves a longer time of detection.</p>
